OpenMP
(API) that may be used to explicitly direct multi-threaded, 
shared memory parallelism in C/C++ programs

#pragma 
creates a parallel region with a team of threads , where each thread will
execute the entire block of code that the parallel region encloses.

CUDA
Compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming enables you to leverage 
parallel computing technologies developed by NVIDIA. 

An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. 
This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is 
important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations.
